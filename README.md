# my pdf reader
 This python project creates mp3 file of your pdf file, so you dont need to waste your eyes on pdfs, just use ears for reading pdf files.
To run this python file, write- 

pip install PyPDF2

and 

pip install gtts 



in your command line


Hurray, you are done, just copy your pdf file in the same directory and run my pdf reader.py in any IDE !


NOTE- After each run do copy Mp3 files to your safe place, because after every run it deletes the mp3 files.
