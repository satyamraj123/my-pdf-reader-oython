# my pdf reader
 This python project creates mp3 file of your pdf file, so you dont need to waste your eyes on pdfs, just use ears for reading pdf files.
To run this python file,

pip install gtts                    in your command line


Hurray, you are done, just copy your pdf file to same directory and run this file in any IDE !
